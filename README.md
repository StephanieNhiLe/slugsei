# SlugSeiAI

## Inspiration

Baseball is a game of precision, but not everyone has access to elite coaching. What if you could see exactly how to improve your swing, down to the smallest detail? 

With SlugSei, players at any level can unlock their potential using real-time data like launch angle (optimized at 10-30 degrees), exit velocity (elite players average 95+ mph), and bat speed (just 1-2 mph faster can add 10-15 feet to your hits). Studies show players using data-driven coaching improve batting averages by up to 20% and gain 5-7 mph in exit velocity in just months. It’s not just practice, it’s practicing smarter. SlugSei makes pro-level insights accessible, so user can see measurable results faster.

## What it does

SlugSei is an AI-powered baseball coach that analyzes your swing mechanics through video and delivers instant, actionable feedback to elevate your hitting performance. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning, it tracks and measures critical metrics to help you improve faster and smarter.

Key Features

- Swing Analysis: Tracks bat speed, stance, hand positioning, follow-through, launch angle, and exit velocity.

- Instant Feedback: Provides real-time insights on your swing mechanics and areas for improvement.

- Performance Tracking: Monitors your progress over time with detailed metrics and trends.

- Personalized Coaching: Offers tailored recommendations and drills based on your unique swing data.

- Pro Comparisons: Compare your swing mechanics to professional athletes for benchmark insights.

- Drill Library: Access customized drills designed to target specific weaknesses and refine your skills.

- Data Storage: Save and review your swing history to track improvement and set goals.

SlugSei turns raw data into actionable steps, helping you practice smarter and see measurable results faster.

## How we built it

We leveraged computer vision models trained on thousands of baseball swings to detect key movement patterns. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, we tracked skeletal motion, while TensorFlow powered our AI models to analyze performance metrics. The backend was built with FastAPI, handling video processing and model inference efficiently, and deployed on Google Cloud Run for scalability. The frontend provides an intuitive dashboard where users can upload videos, view analytics, and receive AI-generated coaching feedback.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring real-time feedback while processing high-resolution video. Optimizing model inference speed without compromising accuracy was tricky. Additionally, fine-tuning the AI to differentiate between small yet significant differences in swing mechanics required extensive training data and validation. Lastly, deploying the system on Cloud Run presented hurdles in managing video processing workloads efficiently.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of:
- Successfully implemented real-time AI-driven swing analysis that provides actionable feedback.
- Optimized video processing to run smoothly on Google Cloud Run, ensuring scalability.
- Developed an intuitive user interface that makes AI coaching accessible to players of all skill levels.
- Trained a robust model that can detect and suggest corrections for swing mechanics with high accuracy.

## What we learned

This project reinforced the importance of efficient model deployment and optimization, especially when handling computationally expensive tasks like video processing. We also learned how to fine-tune AI models for motion analysis and integrate computer vision pipelines into a production-ready environment. Lastly, we gained a deeper appreciation for user experience design, ensuring that AI-generated insights are presented in an easy-to-understand manner for athletes.

## What’s next for Slugger Sensei: AI Baseball Coach

We plan to expand Slugger Sensei’s capabilities by incorporating pitch recognition analysis, allowing batters to train against different pitch types. Additionally, we aim to develop a mobile app for on-the-go swing analysis and integrate real-time feedback via AR overlays. Beyond baseball, we see potential in applying this technology to other sports that rely on biomechanics, such as golf and tennis.

Slugger Sensei is just getting started—our goal is to revolutionize sports training with AI-powered coaching for everyone!
